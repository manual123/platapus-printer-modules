    JSON object or array, yielding as many times as necessary to completely
    iterate through callback.  However, if callback completes its iteration
    without yielding, feed will still yield once before continuing to parse
    JSON.  feed also ignores whatever values are yielded by callback, and
    always yields the index of the next character to be parsed. or None if
    the whole array has been parsed.

    If callback raises an exception feed will raise the same exception.
    The reader will be in its initial state with an empty buffer.
